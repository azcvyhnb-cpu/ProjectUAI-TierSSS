-- Every colour, size, radius, weight and duration in the interface comes from
-- here. No use site writes a literal, which is the only way a project this size
-- stays coherent -- and it is what lets density, accent and text scale change at
-- runtime without hunting through forty files.
--
-- The palette is a warm neutral, not a cool one, and not pure black. Warm because
-- the whole ramp is one hue family with the accent -- a coral -- so a page of prose
-- with two inline code spans in it reads as one material rather than as grey with
-- orange stuck on. Not pure black because on an OLED phone pure black next to a 1px
-- hairline reads as a seam, and a slight lift keeps the surface hierarchy legible at
-- low brightness.
--
-- The lightness steps are deliberately close together at the dark end. The interface
-- it is modelled on separates a sidebar from a canvas from a card by two or three
-- percent of lightness and a hairline, never by a shadow or a heavy fill, and that is
-- what makes it read as flat rather than as a stack of boxes.
