--
-- ask_user raises one of these: the model has met a fork it cannot resolve from the
-- world and the turn is parked on a thread until it is answered. Same contract as the
-- permission prompt -- one at a time, queued, always resolved, closing counts as
-- dismissed -- because the failure mode is the same too: an unresolved question parks
-- the agent until its own timeout.
--
-- It listens to every conversation rather than the open one, for the same reason the
-- permission prompt does: a second conversation left running in the background can
-- ask into a stream nobody is subscribed to, and a question nobody can see is ten
-- minutes of a turn spent for nothing.
