# Project UAI — contract

A universal Roblox AI agent client. Universal means: no game, no gateway and no
host script is assumed. It runs standalone under an executor, embedded in a host
script, or in any context that can call `loadstring`.

Everything below is a contract. Modules are written against it, `test/check.lua`
enforces the mechanical parts, and `test/run.lua` exercises the rest headlessly
under LuaJIT.

## 1. Authoring rules

Luau is written in a dialect that LuaJIT can also parse, so the whole project can
be checked and executed offline. `test/check.lua` fails the build on a violation.

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| No type annotations, no `->`, no `::` | LuaJIT cannot parse them |
| No backtick string interpolation | same; use `string.format` |
| No `continue`, no `goto` | keeps control flow trivially transpilable |
| No `//`, no digit separators, no binary literals | Lua 5.1 lexer |
| Compound assignment (`+=`, `..=`) only as a standalone one-line statement | makes the rewrite to `a = a + (b)` exact |
| Tabs for indentation, no trailing whitespace | matches the reference tree |
| Every module is exactly `return function(env) ... end` | one uniform loader |
| No module reads a global the allowlist does not name | catches typos offline |
| `--!globals name1 name2` extends the allowlist for one file | for the bootstrap only |

## 2. Loader and `env`

A module is a factory. `env.require(id)` loads it once and memoises the result.
`id` is the path under `src/` without the extension: `env.require("ui/theme")`.

```lua
return function(env)
    local theme = env.require("ui/theme")
    local M = {}
    return M
end
```

`env` is built once by `init.lua`:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `env.require(id)` | memoised module loader |
| `env.services` | memoising service proxy — `env.services.CollectionService` |
| `env.hs` `env.uis` `env.tween` `env.run` `env.guisvc` `env.players` | the six hot services |
| `env.plr` | `Players.LocalPlayer` |
| `env.caps` | capability report from `runtime/caps` |
| `env.caps.fn` | resolved executor functions (`request`, `writefile`, `loadstring`, ...) or nil |
| `env.context` | table the host passed in; `{}` when standalone |
| `env.info` | `{ name, version, folder, uaVersion }` |
| `env.root` | the mounted app's `ScreenGui`; absent during UI-free runtime use |

Cycles are a load error, not a hang. `runtime/*` must not require anything above
it; `ui/*` must not require `agent/*` except through `agent/session`.

### Embedding SDK

The full client accepts `context.ui = false` to skip application construction.
Runtime boot still owns capabilities, configuration, providers, sessions, tools,
hooks, and cleanup. Explicit `show`, `toggle`, or `openSession(id)` can mount the
standard app later; `hide` does not mount it. `handle.uiMounted` reports mounting,
not visibility. `context.reuse = true` returns a live copy of the same build
without toggling or replacing its boot context. Changed-build replacement keeps
the existing guarded save/reload contract.

`handle.sdk.version` independently identifies the embedding API, beginning at
`1.0.0`. `features` advertises `uiFreeBoot`, `resourceScopes`, `requests`, and
`sessionLookup`. SDK APIs use dot calls. Public `hooks`, `permissions`, and
`openSession` remove the need to import presentation or lifecycle internals for
ordinary host integrations. `env` and `app` remain implementation escape hatches,
not a promise that all their internals are covered by the SDK version.

`sdk.createScope(id)` owns cleanup functions, UAI/Roblox signal subscriptions,
hooks, and tool registrations. Duplicate live scope IDs are rejected. Scope or
client destruction releases resources once, contains cleanup errors, and removes
only the tool definition it registered. Tool removal denies its pending approval
and invalidates cooperative running calls; it does not undo applied effects or
kill a native call. Scope destruction does not delete conversations or unload a
shared client.

`sdk.request(session, text, options?)` returns a request or `nil, reason` on
admission rejection. Options provide `onEvent`, `onComplete`, and the established
`files`/`images` references. Accepted requests settle exactly once as `succeeded`,
`failed`, or `cancelled`, with `{ ok, status, text, error?, sessionId }`. Host
callbacks are protected. Ordinary settlement follows busy release; removal and
unload settle cancellation even when legacy send callbacks cannot run. Cancelling
targets only that request and stays cooperative. `await(timeoutSeconds?)` returns
the result or `nil, reason`; timeout stops waiting, not the request.

`sessions.get(id)` looks up a registered conversation. `open(id, options?)`
returns `session, created` and selects only with `activate = true`; existing
conversation options otherwise remain unchanged. `newThread` keeps default
activation and accepts `activate = false` and `ephemeral = true`. IDs are bounded
to 120 alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen characters; duplicates cannot replace live
entries. UI-free boot leaves permission policy unchanged, so hosts must provide
an approval presenter or explicitly open the app for work requiring approval.
Creation validates option types and copies string-to-boolean tool maps. Ordinary
session persistence stores a versioned policy containing tool filters/groups/
exclusions, turn/time budgets, unlimited mode, and streaming preference. Valid
policies survive restore. Invalid or future policy versions skip the conversation
without deleting its file; older saves without policy restore legacy defaults.
Saved IDs remain reserved even when their conversations are not registered;
`open` does not load arbitrary archived history or replace a skipped saved file.
Hosts must inspect existing conversation policy before reuse because `open`
does not replace it with newly supplied options.
See [docs/EMBEDDING.md](docs/EMBEDDING.md) for the public contract and examples.

### Standalone script UI library

`ui-lib/src` contains independent factory modules for Project UAI UI LIB, shipped
as `dist/uai-ui.lua`. It shares the application's visual language without changing
the existing `src/ui` application. Script authors declare tabs/sections/controls and
logic; the library owns layout, input, state, lifetime, and the fixed bottom
`Project UAI | UI LIB.` attribution. Navigation and action labels are text-only;
legacy script Icon options are ignored. The library draws its own frame-based
brand mark and window-control glyphs, so no uploaded assets are required. The
sidebar profile uses Roblox headshots with a readable initial, display name,
username and game. Motion is owned, reversible,
and reduced-motion aware; cleanup settles active transitions exactly.
See `docs/UI_LIBRARY.md` for the public API.

`node tools/build_ui_lib.js` deterministically generates the library, SHA-256
manifest, and `runtime/ui_library_docs` from that guide. The read-only
`ui_library_docs` tool supplies bounded UTF-8 pages, and main/subagent prompts
require this library for new script UIs. No UI is mounted by reading the guide.
Imports validate known fields before applying and are silent by default.
Cleanup must release global input listeners, gestures, key holds, owned tasks,
overlays and script resources, including replacement by the same window Id.

## 3. Transport and identity

`net/http` is the only module that performs a request.

* Executor `request` is preferred because it can set `User-Agent`. `HttpService:RequestAsync`
  silently drops that header, so on a vanilla client the Claude Code identity
  cannot be sent — `caps.uaSupported` is false and the UI says so rather than
  pretending.
* Every outbound inference call is stamped by `net/ua`: `User-Agent: claude-cli/<v> (external, cli)`,
  `x-app: cli`, and the `X-Stainless-*` companion set. The stamp happens inside
  `net/http`, so no caller can accidentally skip it.
* No Roblox transport can read a body incrementally. `stream: true` is still
  used: the whole SSE body arrives at once and `net/sse` replays it into deltas,
  which is what makes reasoning text and index-keyed `tool_calls` fragments
  usable. `net/ws` upgrades to real token streaming when the executor exposes
  `WebSocket.connect`, `websocket.connect` or `syn.websocket.connect` and a
  configured gateway implements UAI's envelope protocol. A normal local server
  or OpenAI Responses/Realtime socket does not implement that protocol. See
  [the provider and WebSocket contract](docs/PROVIDER_COMPATIBILITY.md).
* Retries: 408/409/429/5xx and transport errors, exponential backoff with
  jitter, `Retry-After` honoured, capped attempts, then the next provider in the
  fallback chain.
* Native request deadlines, cancellation, malformed streams and response-limit
  errors are terminal. A long unanswered transport failure cannot trigger a
  smaller-request retry, key/provider fallback or a second dispatch after a socket
  send with an unknown outcome. Explicit API refusals can still teach a reply
  ceiling in `record.maxTokensCap = { model, tokens, scope }`; a timeout teaches no cap.
  Learned output caps and request repairs are scoped to endpoint, protocol and
  model. Older saved lessons adopt the current scope on first use.
  Both provider adapters protect retry callbacks and enforce these terminal states.
* Both adapters parse context-length refusals separately from output-token limits.
  A named window of at least 512 tokens is saved under the lowercased model id in
  `agent.forceContext`, only lowering an existing value. Like `record.maxTokensCap`,
  the learned value persists; the context map is also included in configuration
  export. The loop compacts against the refusing model and retries it once before
  continuing the fallback chain. Cancellation and a history with nothing to fold
  do not trigger repeated requests.
* Buffered HTTP and socket fallback use the configured output budget and model
  limits; the old `agent.executorReplyCeiling` setting is ignored. Native transports
  bound a request to at most 300 seconds and 8 MiB; individual executors and servers
  may stop sooner. A socket uses the effective `stream` body value and the full
  provider path/query. Connect/setup failures before `Send` may fall back to HTTP;
  failures after entering `Send` remain terminal. The Messages adapter uses HTTP
  or the web relay and does not use `wsUrl`.
* Base URLs preserve explicit schemes, path prefixes and query strings. Bare local,
  LAN and private addresses default to HTTP; public hosts default to HTTPS. Local
  reachability is checked by URL, including custom records. Model-list caches are
  scoped to connection/auth settings, keep drafts separate and reject stale results
  and HTTP error documents; manual model ids remain available.
* Secrets are redacted in the request log; only the last four characters of a
  key are displayed in diagnostic views, and the Providers panel never renders the
  key itself. Full configuration export is an explicit private transfer: it includes
  complete credentials in clipboard JSON and is clearly labelled. Its import preview
  reports counts and provider names without displaying keys.
* `util.encode` is the only path to `JSONEncode`, and it scrubs on the way through:
  every string is repaired to valid UTF-8, NaN and the infinities become `0`, and a
  function, userdata or thread becomes a marker rather than a raise. This is not
  defensive coding for its own sake. `JSONEncode` refuses a string with one stray
  Latin-1 byte in it and raises `Can't convert to JSON` with no position, because it
  is a C function; a web search's scraped snippet is full of candidates; and the tool
  result is already in the message history by then, so the failure repeats on every
  following turn. `util.truncate` and `util.ellipsis` cut on character boundaries for
  the same reason — both index in bytes and would otherwise bisect an em dash.

## 4. Provider records

```lua
{
    id = "openai",                       -- stable key
    label = "OpenAI",
    baseUrl = "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    apiKey = "sk-...",
    authStyle = "bearer",                -- bearer | x-api-key | api-key | both | none
    models = { "gpt-4o" },               -- only what the user added or picked
    model = "gpt-4o",                    -- current selection
    headers = { ["HTTP-Referer"] = "" }, -- extra per-provider headers
    params = { temperature = 0.7 },      -- extra body fields
    stream = true,
    enabled = true,
    order = 1,
    claudeUa = true,                     -- send the Claude Code identity
    health = { ok = 0, fail = 0, lastError = "", cooldownUntil = 0 },
}
```

Base URLs are normalised once: a trailing slash is dropped, a missing `/v1` is
added unless the URL already names a path, and a URL that already ends in
`/chat/completions` is used verbatim.

`registry.requiresClaude(record)` recognizes `agentrouter.org` and its subdomains,
including manually entered endpoints. `identityFor` returns `claude` there even
when `record.claudeUa` is false. Inference and model-discovery requests mark this
identity as required, so `net/http` applies its headers despite the global switch
or conflicting custom headers. The provider UI explains the requirement instead
of offering a toggle. The featured preset uses `https://agentrouter.org` with the
Anthropic Messages adapter, producing `https://agentrouter.org/v1/messages`.

An explicit unauthorized-client refusal from the standard OpenCode Zen or
AgentRouter endpoint can switch that record to the Project UAI HTTPS proxy at
`puai-proxy.davidzk.tech/opencode/v1` or `/agentrouter/v1`, respectively. Both
adapters and model discovery retry once within the original HTTP deadline.
Only exact supported official hosts/routes qualify; invalid credentials,
unrelated errors, custom endpoints, timeouts and cancellation never cause this
switch. Registered records persist the URL, while editor drafts stay local until
Save. Required vendor identity, query fields and credentials remain intact;
known proxy routes use HTTP rather than an unrelated WebSocket gateway. The UI
discloses that requests and keys pass through the proxy and its shared daily cap
of 90,000 requests. The Base URL remains editable.

HCNSEC setup offers an explicitly selected community key for its official HTTPS
endpoint. Applying it replaces the editor draft's key pool and resets rotation;
it neither replaces saved credentials nor selects a guessed model. Keys remain
masked in the provider UI, including this intentionally distributed shared key.

**Models are never guessed.** Presets carry no model list. `provider/models`
resolves a provider's models from exactly two sources — ids the user added by
hand (which rank first, and persist on the record) and whatever `GET /v1/models`
reported (cached for ten minutes, not persisted). Nothing is filtered out of the
endpoint's answer, because deciding which of its ids are chat models would be a
guess. An endpoint with no `/models` route is a normal case: the Providers editor
takes a typed id, and saving requires one.

Rolling compaction feeds the previous summary back to the summarizer with newly
removed turns. Failed or disabled summary calls preserve earlier facts and append
a note about dropped messages. The context inspector uses the same pressure and
limit calculation as compaction: estimated messages and summary plus prepared
system/schema overhead. Usage is calibrated against a dispatch-time snapshot and
scoped to provider ID, endpoint and model; changing prompts adjusts the estimate.
Before the first prepared request, totals are labelled partial. Its colored bar
uses the model window when known and the compaction point otherwise; the marker
and legend make that scale explicit. Category labels reserve the remaining row
width, and live refreshes are coalesced and disconnected when the inspector closes.

Native requests no longer apply an executor-specific output ceiling; saved
`agent.executorReplyCeiling` values are ignored. Genuine socket frames produce
transient `assistant:preview` events through `agent/stream`, with coalesced 64 KiB
text/reasoning previews and cancellation. Final text/reasoning replace their
previews and are retained once; buffered HTTP replies render immediately without
simulated typing. The prompt requests brief assistant-content updates between
tool steps. Tokens cannot be displayed before the host/provider delivers them.

Generation settings live in `runtime/config` and are persisted in `UAI/config.json`:

| Setting | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent.maxTokens` | 128000 | Saved reply limit; model limits and learned per-model caps apply when constructing requests. |
| `agent.contextTokens` | 1000000 | Context budget before compaction. Larger contexts spend more of an executor's request window on upload and prefill. |

## 5. Tool contract

```lua
{
    name = "instance_find",
    group = "instance",
    risk = "read",                 -- read | write | danger
    needs = { "loadstring" },      -- capability keys, checked before dispatch
    description = "...",           -- what the model sees
    parameters = { type = "object", properties = {}, required = {} },
    run = function(args, ctx) return "text" end,
}
```

`ctx` carries `emit(kind, text)` for progress, `aborted()`, `env`, `session`,
`depth` (subagent nesting) and `budget`. A handler returns a string, or a table
`{ text = "...", data = <table> }` when the UI can render something richer. A
handler may yield. Raising an error is caught and reported to the model as a tool
error, not a crash. Returning `{ ok = false, text = "..." }` reports a semantic
failure without raising. Dispatch rechecks disabled groups and the session's tool
filters before execution, including after a pending approval resolves.

The prompt asks for successive batches of normally 1–4 independent calls, waits
for their results, and discourages dozens of calls in one response. Dependent
calls and changes to the same file or runtime state run in successive steps.
This is prompt guidance only; tool-call limits and concurrency are unchanged.

Inputs over 8,000 UTF-8 bytes become verified files in `UAI/pastes/`, with a
2 MiB maximum per file. Preserve the original bytes, including whitespace, and
send only a compact path/size/line-count reference without a source preview.
Short messages stay inline. The native composer separates a large inserted
block from the surrounding editable text; attachment-only sends are valid.
The browser transfers long text through ordered `attachment:upload` commands
before `send`, with conversation ownership, byte offsets and idempotent retries.
Only a verified final write produces a usable reference. Failed saves, missing
files or unavailable file tools leave the draft intact and never send the long
source inline. These are executor workspace files, not provider-specific uploads.
Browser images use a separate compact, session-scoped reference in model context.
The bridge resolves that reference to actual Chat Completions or Messages image
blocks only at provider dispatch; image-bearing requests use the relay regardless
of the selected runtime. No image bytes enter Lua context or transcript events.
Missing current images fail with a reattach instruction; expired images in older
user turns become explicit unavailable-image text. Old clients without imageInput
capability cannot accept image sends. Vision support depends on the model.
Explicit `files/` and `pastes/` paths resolve before bare-name fallbacks; client
configuration is never a fallback scope. Saved-paste slices return at most 6,000
source bytes with UTF-8-safe continuation offsets, including batch reads.

The prompt directs game-specific work into a per-place folder under `files/`,
named `<place name> (<PlaceId>)` from the environment block with path-reserved
characters (`<>:"|?*` and trailing dots or spaces) removed. Scripts the agent
authors or edits go in that folder's root; decompiled or dumped source goes in
its `dump/` subfolder. This is prompt guidance, not an enforced boundary: the
file tools still resolve any valid path under `files/`, so shared utilities and
cross-game files stay reachable.

`run_luau` uses a separate managed executor with a default 10-second deadline
(configurable to 1–60 seconds), cooperative loop checkpoints, bounded output, and
capture of multiple returns. Functions scheduled through its task wrappers share
the deadline and complete before the result is delivered. Stop, failure, timeout,
and unload stop managed tasks cooperatively without native `task.cancel`. Pending
Roblox/executor continuations retain live coroutines instead of targeting closed
ones. Managed delays use cancellable wait slices; explicit cancellation accepts
only this execution's task handles, treats finished handles as a no-op, and exits
self-cancelling tasks inside their protected wrapper. Work suspended outside
managed waits may still resume before its next checkpoint, which is disclosed.
Dynamically loaded code, native engine calls, and persistent engine-signal
callbacks are outside this guarantee. Failed turns invalidate their tool contexts;
starting another main or subagent turn cannot revive old workers.

`check_luau` only compiles. Both `check_luau` and `run_luau` accept either inline
`code` or a saved `path`, using the same workspace/paste resolution as `file_read`.
This keeps saved source out of repeated model output. `file_edit` requires an exact
unique match unless replace-all is explicit, permits empty replacement text, and refuses stale file
contents. `file_read` and `script_source` use contiguous UTF-8 slices with 1-based
byte offsets and continuation cursors; each slice fits the registry's result budget.
`file_write` and `file_append` advertise and enforce a 2 MiB content limit per call
before disk access. The prompt and tool descriptions direct edits of existing
large files to `file_edit`/`file_edit_many`; full writes create files or replace
most of their contents. Large new scripts use small sequential writes/appends,
then syntax checks and execution by path. JSON repair preserves the complete outer
object and rejects unclosed strings. Mutating tools also reject missing closers
instead of dropping unfinished edits/options. A token-limited tool batch produces
an error result for every call without executing any, allowing the model to send
smaller complete calls on its next step.

Main and subagent prompts require reading every enabled skill before replying or
performing other work in each new or resumed conversation. The environment supplies
names, filenames and descriptions; `skills_read` supplies the body. Both skill
bodies and `skills_list` paginate through UTF-8-safe byte offsets within the result
budget. Restricted subagent presets include the skills group and explicitly exclude
its write/install/delete tools. Disabled skills remain unreadable; denied or
unavailable reads do not require retries. Changed skills and bodies lost through
compaction must be read again.

The Project Gravity tool group resolves the live `_GRAVITY_CONTEXT` for each
action, falling back to `env.context.gravity`. Desktop and mobile Gravity
launchers pass that context explicitly. Initialization publishes the handle;
teardown clears only its own handle. Reloaded or torn-down contexts cannot be
used for a pending mutation. `gravity_status` is available without a connection;
engine and shape operations use the dynamic `gravity` capability and normal
permissions. Shape catalogs and control metadata come from the live runtime and
paginate; controls use their real keys and stored slider units, including `Div`,
`IntOnly` and the native speed-range extension. Setting batches validate before
mutation, preserve table identities, and invoke the relevant native handlers.

`gravity_parts` lists the authoritative held-part map in claim-ID order, with
filters, continuation offsets and at most 25 records per call. IDs include the
Gravity session ID; stale or cross-session IDs cannot select a new part.
`gravity_part_control` uses the native selection/assignment/ride/physics/release
handlers, requires the guarded Part Control API, and honors the native 512-part
selection ceiling. Shape loads recheck cancellation, session identity and the
entire selected-record snapshot before assignment. Group movement preserves
spacing, using current pin/manual targets or the parts' world positions.
Selection clearing retains overrides; `release_all` includes unselected ride and
physics overrides even without a mode. Per-part overrides are session state.

Engine configuration also covers UI scale, HUD, visual performance, FPS, core RGB
color, ignore tags and Part Control panel defaults. FPS requires native executor
support. Typed batches validate before mutation and restore previous settings
when a native effect fails, reporting an incomplete restoration when necessary.
Part Control defaults are separate from assigning overrides to a selection.
`gravity_keybind` rebinds native core/shape shortcuts after rejecting collisions;
`gravity_favorite` changes the native favorites table and selector. A settings
reset uses Gravity's complete reset hook, including visual restoration, hotkeys,
control refresh and post-startup plugin defaults. `persist=false` avoids requesting
a save for settings, keybindings, favorites, shape selection and reset. Manual
Slingshot launch/charge requires that shape and its manual-control mode.

`gravity_plugin_read` supplies the module guide, template or bounded local/official
source slices. `gravity_plugin_write` accepts source or a saved file path, checks
syntax, verifies the real `GravityShapes/` file, and requires `overwrite=true` for
replacement. Default loading runs setup once under the existing execution deadline,
validates the returned module and controls, cleans up a previous module and
preserves compatible settings. An inactive shape is not selected automatically.
`load=false` saves syntax-checked source without executing it. Replacements check
for file/runtime changes during setup; failed verification restores the previous
file where possible. Released plugin callbacks have no setup deadline but retain
explicit task cancellation; persistent callbacks require plugin-owned cleanup.

Infinite Yield tools read the running engine's environment, for both an ambient
IY and a captured internal load. `iy_cmds` joins the executable command registry
with IY's `CMDs` signature/description list by name or alias, retaining the first
description for a token and limiting descriptions to 120 bytes. Older engines
without `CMDs` retain name/alias/plugin output. Filtering and result limits remain
available.

`iy_players` is a read tool with no extra host capability requirement. It delegates
`selector` to IY's `getPlayer(selector, localPlayer)` and returns `{ names, count }`
alongside text limited to 50 names by default (maximum 200). Empty matches and
unavailable resolvers are explicit. Supported selector syntax follows the live
IY, including `all`, `others`, `me`, `random`, `#<n>`, `%<team>`, `allies`, `enemies`,
`team`, `nonteam`, `friends`, `nonfriends`, `guests`, `bacons`, `age<n>`, `nearest`,
`farthest`, `group<id>`, `alive`, `dead`, `rad<n>`, `cursor`, `npcs`, `+`/`-`, and
comma-separated lists. In the reviewed upstream version, `@name` matches username
prefixes without considering display names.

`iy_control` retains write permission for its combined inspect/edit surface.
Inspection sections are `all`, `events`, `keybinds`, `settings`, `aliases`, and
`waypoints`. Alias and waypoint sections expose 1-based indexes, `items`, `total`,
and `nextOffset`; malformed entries are labeled and still advance pagination.
Waypoint inspection includes coordinates, the place ID and the all-place count
when available.

The existing event/keybind actions and `stop_loops` are joined by:

- `alias_add`, `alias_remove`, `alias_clear`: validate command names and aliases,
  update both `aliases` and `customAlias`, refresh the native editor, and request
  IY's save. Adds use the first command token and reject unknown commands, duplicate
  aliases, native command collisions, whitespace and IY command delimiters.
- `waypoint_add`, `waypoint_remove`, `waypoint_clear`: validate names and finite
  coordinates, floor explicit or current-root coordinates, and update `WayPoints`
  plus `AllWaypoints`. Removal is case-insensitive and scoped to the current place,
  including legacy entries without a place ID. Clear defaults to the current place;
  `all_places=true` explicitly clears all saved places. Tables are cleared in place
  so native GUI references remain live. The buggy upstream coordinate command is
  not used.
- `configure` additionally accepts `gui_scale` (0.4–2) and `logs_webhook` (HTTP(S)
  URL or empty to disable). These use `guiscale` and `chatlogswebhook`, report
  asynchronous dispatch, and require saving because the native commands save
  themselves. `persist=false` remains available for direct native edits; mode
  changes alone continue to work without loading IY.

Batch tools use the existing `instance` and `fs` groups and the same permission
and capability checks as individual operations. Array schemas enforce `minItems`
and `maxItems` before dispatch; oversized arrays are rejected before visiting
their members.

- `instance_query` combines name/class/tag filters with up to 12 selected
  properties and 12 attributes. `instance_get_many` accepts up to 20 known paths
  with per-path failures. Fields are compact and bounded; bulk projections
  direct Source reads to `script_source`.
- `instance_find` and `instance_query` walk children incrementally, without
  allocating a whole descendant list. Scans stop as soon as a page fills, yield
  cooperatively, and inspect at most 20,000 nodes. Query offsets refer to the
  current traversal order; restart if the tree changes. An incomplete scan must
  never be presented as proof of absence.
- `file_search` searches single-line literals in the files scope or an explicit
  `pastes/` path, supporting
  filename globs and a case-sensitive option. Its inventory caps are 128
  directories, 1,000 files, and 6,000 entries. It skips binary files and files
  over 2 MB and scans at most 8 MB and 50,000 new lines per page. The read budget
  counts skipped data and is checked between whole-file reads: hosts expose no
  portable stat/range API, so the final read can exceed it. Returned cursors
  include a path, line, and (where available) direct byte offset. Continue with
  the same search; restart after source changes. Read errors and incomplete
  inventories appear in both text and structured results.
- `file_read_many` accepts up to 12 files or saved pastes, each up to 2 MB. It
  shares the configured output budget, retains individual failures, and returns
  per-slice offsets plus a request index if the batch fills the page. Repeated
  slices reuse at most 2 MB of cached content within that call only.
- `file_edit_many` accepts 1–20 ordered exact edits to one workspace file. Each
  edit sees the previous edit's proposed result. Every match and size check must
  pass before rereading the original to check staleness and performing one write.
  An unchanged result performs no write. Original and resulting files are
  bounded to 2 MB. Cancellation before the write returns an aborted status.

Instance paths are parsed, never executed. Dotted paths continue to work;
JSON-quoted bracket segments preserve exact names, including punctuation and
surrounding whitespace. Known `Character`, `CurrentCamera`, and `PrimaryPart`
links can resolve when no named child exists. String property coercion preserves
whitespace, and scalar numeric coercion rejects nonfinite values.

### Script projects

The existing `coding` group also registers `project_scaffold`, `project_map`,
`project_patch`, `project_patch_read`, `project_patch_apply`,
`project_patch_restore`, `project_patch_discard`, `script_analyze`, `script_test`
and `project_build`. Runtime modules own project snapshots, lexical outlines and
proposals; tool modules own permission-aware execution and editor-draft checks.
See [docs/SCRIPT_PROJECTS.md](docs/SCRIPT_PROJECTS.md) for their public contract.

Version-1 JSON manifests explicitly map module IDs to relative source files,
declare an entry and optional tests. Sources remain under `files/`; paths reject
traversal and case aliases. Limits are 64 modules, 16 test modules, 256,000 bytes
per source, 1 MiB per project and 32,000 bytes per manifest/fixture JSON. Builds
produce deterministic editable bundles up to 256,000 bytes with source locations;
they compile without executing and cannot overwrite project inputs.

Project patches retain complete original/proposed bytes, require observed hashes
for existing files, preflight all targets and verify individual writes. Hashes are
conflict identifiers, not cryptographic proofs. Apply and restore refuse unsaved
bound Code drafts. Clean editor views keep their existing Save conflict detection.
Eight conversation-owned proposals/checkpoints retain at most 8 MiB (2 MiB each),
expire after ten minutes/unload, and never persist to disk. Writes are not atomic;
partial results retain recovery source. Restore refuses external or unverified
partial bytes and removes only files whose recorded current content still matches.

Analysis explicitly distinguishes host syntax compilation, lexical outlines and
literal dependency checks from unsupported type/API inference. Missing compilers
are reported; build/test require one. Lexical scanning caps at 50,000 tokens and
256 symbols/imports each, reports omissions, and treats interpolation as opaque.
Columns are byte positions. Literal cycles are conservatively rejected; shadowed
requires can produce false dependency reports. Bundled require resolves only
declared project IDs, memoizes false, converts nil to true and detects active cycles.

Test modules return named functions receiving assertions and fixture data. Each
case gets fresh module caches/fixtures, but native client state is shared. Tests
use the existing managed execution engine, high-impact permission, cancellation
and 1–60 second deadline, with at most 100 cases per run. They are not a security
sandbox, isolated process or native Roblox validation. Main and subagent prompts
describe review, build, output inspection and focused test/repair workflows.

## 6. Event stream

`agent/loop` never touches the interface. It emits into `agent/session`, which
fans out to subscribers. Every payload also carries `kind` and `at` (epoch ms),
stamped by `session.emit`.

| kind | payload |
| --- | --- |
| `user` | `{ text }` |
| `status` | `{ text }` |
| `turn:start` / `turn:end` | `{ turns, unlimited }` / `{ text }` |
| `request:start` | `{ provider, providerId, model, attempt, messages, stream }` |
| `request:retry` | `{ provider, attempt, attempts, status, wait, reason }` |
| `request:done` | `{ provider, model, ms, streamed, via }` or `{ provider, model, ms, error }` |
| `provider:switch` | `{ from, to, reason }` |
| `assistant:text` | `{ text, final }` |
| `assistant:reasoning` | `{ text }` |
| `tool:call` | `{ id, name, group, risk, arguments }` (arguments is the raw JSON string) |
| `tool:progress` | `{ id, name, text }` — scoped to its originating call |
| `tool:result` / `tool:error` | the dispatch result: `{ id, name, ok, text, ms, risk, group, args, error, full, truncated, data }` |
| `permission:ask` | `{ id, name, group, risk, description, args, resolve }` |
| `usage` | `{ session, turn }` — the two counter tables from `agent/usage` |
| `compact` | `{ summary, before, after }` |
| `subagent:start` | `{ id, call, label, task, preset, turns, budget, unlimited, depth, followUp }` |
| `subagent:status` / `subagent:text` | `{ id, call, label, text, bad? }` |
| `subagent:tool` / `subagent:tool:done` | `{ id, callId, name, risk, arguments, index }` / `{ …, ok, ms, summary }` |
| `subagent:done` | `{ id, ms, ok, aborted, messages, turns, resumable, text }` |
| `cleared` | `{}` |
| `error` | `{ message, fatal }` |
| `abort` | `{}` |

Parallel tool results are emitted as each call finishes. The batch still returns
results in the original call order for model context. A progress event without an
ID is rendered only when one call is open, so legacy emitters cannot overwrite the
status of unrelated parallel work. Failed and stopped turns restore Ready status.

The task list does not travel on this stream: `agent/state` owns it and publishes
`todosChanged(items, session)`, because the list outlives a turn and a panel opened
later has to be able to read it rather than replay it. The list itself lives on the
session (`session.todos`), so `setTodos`, `todoCounts`, `todoBlock` and `todoList`
all take the session they are about and the subscriber filters on the second
argument. A client-wide list is not an option: two conversations can run at once,
and one plan for both means a running turn resumes against somebody else's steps.

`agent/session.anyEvent` fires `(session, payload)` for every event of every
session. A surface that must answer a conversation nobody is looking at subscribes
there rather than to `session.events`; `ui/panels/permission` is the case that
requires it, since a prompt raised by a background conversation has to reach the
screen or its own deadline denies every call behind it. Subscribers must skip
`session.headless` -- a subagent's prompts are forwarded onto its parent's stream,
so the child's own copy is a duplicate.

Pending permission requests are per-session too. `permissions.request` records the
asking session on the entry, `denyAll(reason, session)` sweeps only that
conversation's prompts, and `pendingCount(session)` counts them. `denyAll()` with
no session still clears everything, which is what an unload wants.

Every dispatch is registered in `agent/subagent`: `records` (running first, finished
history capped at 24), the `changed` signal, `list`, `running`, `resumable`, `get`,
`find(reference)`, `stop(id)`, `stopAll` and `clearHistory`. A record carries `id,
label, task, preset, depth, parentId, parentTitle, startedAt, status, calls,
finishedCalls, tools, currentTool, statusText, ms, messages, runs, unlimited, report`,
the `parent` session currently waiting on it and the `callId` inside that session, and
the child `session` that `stop` sets `abortFlag` on. `status` is one of `queued`,
`running`, `done`, `stopped`, `failed`. A stop is noticed between steps, not on the
instant -- Luau cannot kill a thread.

A dispatch is a conversation, not a single question. `dispatch_agent` creates the
child and returns its id in the report; `agent_followup` runs the same session again
against the context it already has, which is what `followUp(id, task)` does and what
`runs` counts. `parent` and `callId` live on the record rather than in a closure
because the turn asking a follow-up is a different tool call, possibly in a different
conversation, and the live card has to appear under the row the user is looking at
now. Only the newest `RESUMABLE` (6) finished records keep their `session`; past that
the record keeps its report and the context behind it is released, so `followUp`
refuses with a reason rather than resuming something that is no longer there.

`agent.subagentUnlimited` lifts a child's step limit and wall-clock budget and makes
the dispatching tool call wait as long as the child takes. It is separate from
`agent.unlimitedTurns`, which the loop applies only to a session with no step budget
of its own: the dispatcher passes its decision down as `session.unlimited`, so a
delegated child is lifted only when that has been asked for in those words. What
still bounds a child either way: the repeat breaker, each tool's own timeout, the
provider retry cap, the depth and concurrency ceilings, and Stop.

`agent/transcript` owns each session's bounded, chronological `session.log`.
Dialogue/notices have 512 events within 1 MiB; subagent start/report records have
128 events within 256 KiB; detailed activity has 256 events within 256 KiB.
Activity cannot spend the dialogue budget. Calls/results and dispatch start/report
records are evicted as groups, preferring completed work; removing a dispatch
also removes its dependent activity. Limits still apply to hosts that never finish
their calls. Fields are bounded, UTF-8-safe primitives; callbacks and result graphs
are excluded. Pending progress is coalesced separately and released on completion.

Persistence writes the same snapshot plus versioned omission/recovery metadata;
it does not apply a second FIFO that discards the protected dialogue. Legacy files
recover missing prose still present in saved model context, preserving repeated
prompts and avoiding duplicated overlap. Text already lost from both stores cannot
be reconstructed. Modern intentional retention limits are not undone by recovery.

The transcript subscribes before taking its replay snapshot and renders at most
12 events or approximately 6 ms per scheduled slice. Durable events arriving during
replay queue in order; current preview/progress is reconciled afterward. Generations
cancel work on switch, clear and destruction. Completed replay buffers and expired
GUI rows are released; dialogue uses measured spacers and mounts only nearby
message/Markdown chunks in batches of up to four, yielding between batches.
Visible chunks take priority over prefetch. A bounded warm set keeps nearby
renderers for backtracking; scroll-only passes reuse the sibling geometry index.
An upward scroll releases follow immediately, and reflow preserves the visible
Markdown chunk inside a long reply when that chunk remains mounted. New replies
below the reader appear in the Latest control without taking their position.
Tool activity starts as a compact summary with running, completed and failed
counts. Opening details is a reading action: the header stays anchored and results
never change the reader's chosen disclosure state. Tool inputs and outputs render
on demand. Delegated tasks keep their goal, status and report separate from their
folded activity, with stable row identities for retention and incremental replay.
Hidden/minimized views suspend drawing and retain their bounded renderer cache,
live preview, expanded sections and reading anchor. Returning from native tabs or
minimize queues only unseen events; unchanged history takes no replay slices and
does not rebuild its text. Session switches, clear and destruction release the
appropriate content. Retained nested agents survive removal of a dispatch row.
History notices disclose retention/recovery. Reading position and follow preference
are session-local, with a measured message anchor when available. **Refresh
conversation** redraws the view without changing the session or composer draft.
Calls without a saved outcome stop spinning on idle restore and state that no result
was kept. Conversation search includes retained dialogue after model compaction.

## 6a. What is counted, and where

`agent/stats` is the only place a figure the interface displays as a statistic
comes from. It observes the stream through the `onEvent` hook and the
`usage.recorded` signal, buckets everything by local day and local hour, and
persists to `stats.json`.

* A number is recorded or it is absent. Nothing is modelled, sampled or
  interpolated, and no surface may compute a headline figure of its own.
* Tokens are counted from the first request this store ever sees. There is no
  history to recover -- `agent/usage` has always been in-memory -- and an
  estimate would be a figure with no measurement behind it.
* Messages and conversations *are* recovered once, on the first run, from the
  real timestamps in the transcripts already on disk.
* A subagent's requests and tokens count toward the conversation that dispatched
  it; its messages do not, because nobody typed or read them.
* Buckets are local, via `runtime/clock`: `dayKey`, `hourOf`, `dayNumber`. The
  conversion is arithmetic on the epoch plus this host's UTC offset, probed once
  from `DateTime`, because Roblox's pattern formatter is the only calendar API
  and its pattern support differs between client versions.

Persisted files, all under one folder (`env.info.folder`, default `UAI/`):

| file | written by | holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config.json` | `runtime/config` | every setting, the provider list, permission rules, memory |
| `sessions/<id>.json` | `agent/session` | one conversation: context, transcript, title, place and timestamps; newest 64 restored, older disk history retained |
| `sessions/.folders.1.json`, `.folders.2.json` | `runtime/conversation_folders` | alternating verified custom-folder catalogs; names, stable IDs and revision |
| `stats.json` | `agent/stats` | per-day and per-model counters; days capped at 400 |
| `export/*.json` | the Import & export pane | a shareable copy of the settings, with keys reduced to four characters |

## 7. Design tokens

Conversation organization is independent from execution context. Sessions retain
their recorded place and policy when moved into Universal or a custom folder.
`agent/session` exposes `folders`, `groups`, `folderLabel`, `createFolder`,
`renameFolder`, `removeFolder`, and `moveToFolder`; creation accepts `folderId`.
Legacy saves use their recorded game. Removing a custom folder preserves chats,
including archived memberships, which resolve to Universal without rewriting
archived or unsupported-policy files. Up to 64 custom folders have unique names
of at most 120 UTF-8 bytes. Unreadable or future-format catalogs block edits;
an intact older snapshot can recover a damaged newer snapshot.

No use site writes a raw colour or number. `ui/theme` exposes `theme.color.*`,
`theme.text.*` (role -> size/font/lineHeight/height), `theme.space.*`,
`theme.size.*`, `theme.radius.*`, `theme.stroke.*`, `theme.opacity.*`,
`theme.scale.*`, `theme.motion.*`, `theme.z.*`. `ui/responsive` reports the active
breakpoint and layout mode from the live viewport, so a window that opens on a
phone and is then rotated re-lays-out rather than keeping whatever was true at
boot; it holds no metrics of its own.

The palette is one warm neutral ramp of twelve steps plus one accent. Surfaces are
separated by two or three steps of lightness and a hairline, never by a shadow or a
heavy fill; the code surface sits *below* the canvas rather than above it -- except
under the light code palette, which inverts that pair deliberately and separates the
block from the page with its own border instead. The accent is reserved for meaning
-- inline code, a running turn, a risk level -- and the single loud control per view
is `color.solid`, a cream fill with dark text, which is deliberately not the accent.
`test/run.lua` computes WCAG contrast over every pair the interface actually puts
together, for every accent and every code palette, and fails the build under 4.5:1
for text, so a token cannot be retuned into something unreadable.

Four token groups are settings rather than constants, and each has to change what
is on screen or it is decoration:

| setting | token | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ui.interfaceFont` | every non-mono `theme.text.*.font` and `.face` | the family the interface is set in |
| `ui.codeFont` | `theme.text.mono`, `theme.text.monoSmall`, `theme.codeFontEnumName` | the family code is set in, fenced and inline |
| `ui.codeTheme` | `color.codeSurface`, `codeBar`, `codeText`, `codeGutter`, `codeAdd*`, `codeRemove*` | a light or dark code palette, in the transcript as well as the preview |
| `ui.transcriptWidth` | `size.reading` | how wide the transcript and composer columns grow |

Type resolves in two layers. `theme.text.<role>.font` is an `Enum.Font` and always
takes; `.face` is a `FontFace` carrying the family plus an independent weight, and
`P.text` layers it over the enum only when the client produced one -- so `strong` is a
real SemiBold where the modern type stack exists and degrades to the family's legacy
medium where it does not. The family list is *discovered*: each candidate is read back
off the engine with `Font.fromEnum` and dropped when the member is absent, so a name
this client cannot load can never be offered. A hardcoded `rbxasset://fonts/families`
path has the opposite failure mode -- it constructs fine and renders nothing.

A clickable row uses `P.rowButton`: the button *is* the row and the layout goes
inside it. A transparent full-size button dropped in beside a row's contents does
not layer over them -- a `UIListLayout` gives it a slot of its own and pushes them
past the row's edge, where they are still drawn because nothing clips them.

The window root is a plain `Frame` on every device. Large transcripts do not depend
on a CanvasGroup's offscreen texture allocation, resolution or fade state. The
shell has no entrance `UIScale`; hide/show is synchronous. Centered dimensions
retain whole-pixel parity through `handle.centred`. Maximize changes geometry and
its icon in place, keeping the transcript, live preview, focus and drafts mounted.

Entrance scales on plain frames (the modal card, the settings dialog, quick chat) are
allowed -- a `UIScale` there re-lays-out rather than resampling -- but each one snaps to
exactly 1 on `Completed`, because an interrupted tween otherwise leaves the surface
laid out at 98% of its own metrics for as long as it is open.

The transcript canvas uses `UIListLayout.AbsoluteContentSize` plus vertical padding.
Lightweight spacers preserve the measured size of unmounted dialogue. Drawing
work is bounded independently of the retained event count, and data retention
does not depend on the visibility of the window.
Transient zero measurements during hidden/resizing states do not erase a populated
canvas. Geometry changes preserve follow intent and restore a measured reading
anchor instead of forcing the reader to the newest row. Markdown replacements are
built before old content is released; a failed block falls back to readable text.

Breakpoints: `xs < 520`, `sm < 900`, `md < 1280`, `lg < 1700`, `xl`. Layout modes:
`sheet` (xs), `panel` (sm, touch-only input, and any portrait orientation), `window` (md+), plus `tv`
when `GuiService:IsTenFootInterface()`. These modes control placement and bounds;
phones use the same application components and navigation as desktop. Handheld
layout metrics use 55% of desktop dimensions, spacing and radii before user
density settings. Handheld text has a 10px baseline minimum before the user's
text scale; standard icons have a 12px minimum to retain their strokes.
Controls have a 15px minimum on handhelds, 28px
with a pointer and 48px on a console. Native dimensions are reduced directly;
the application is not resampled through a UIScale.

The shared header retains its brand, detail and Minimize/Maximise/Close actions.
The shared welcome view, composer, Quick Chat, Code tabs and document tabs remain
present, including the normal sidebar. Its collapse control and regular app menu
remain available. Settings categories and provider lists use their normal
column or horizontally scrolling strip according to the available width. Menus
use the same anchored, bounded, scrolling presentation on every device.

Ordinary handheld typing stays compact until explicitly expanded. In short
keyboard space, the same multiline input contracts without replacing its native
field or changing its draft. Quick Chat retains its field, draft and selection
on rotation, and mobile Return inserts a newline. Slider gestures wait for
horizontal intent, so vertical page swipes cannot alter values. Code, table and
reasoning scroll areas account for keyboard-obstructed height. Settings
categories retain live fields and their individual scroll positions.
Short Code surfaces scroll the original composition as a whole; controls stay
mounted in their normal rows instead of moving into separate mobile menus.

The Discord invitation is an app-owned optional modal. Automatic display requires
five minutes since mounting and 30 seconds of idle time in a visible focused
Chat/Home view, with no draft, focused field, other overlay, scrolled-back chat,
keyboard or active request. Busy transitions and window focus changes reset idle
time. Persisted cooldown is 14 days, with at most one display per loaded client.
Dismissal keeps the cooldown; opting out or successfully copying the invite
disables reminders. Manual menu access stays available. UI-free boot schedules
nothing; screen destruction and runtime disposal release the watcher.

On touch devices, Enter inserts a newline; only Send submits. Attachments use the
shared wrapping scroll region, with management available from Message options
when keyboard space hides their preview.
Rotation relays out existing views without replacing their text fields,
selections or live forms. Collapsing the sidebar does not rebuild the window or
transcript. The shared conversation search opens a matching chat directly;
conversation management remains in the sidebar and app menu. The
mobile launcher is visible only while the main window is minimized.

Sheets, panels and desktop windows can all be moved. Default desktop placement
avoids CoreGui's top bar, but dragging and restoring a chosen position use the full
device-safe parent, measured through a transparent frame inside the ScreenGui.
The top-bar inset is not a physical obstruction across that whole parent. Geometry
is recorded on release, separately in `ui.window`, `ui.mobilePanel` and
`ui.mobileSheet`; maximised or keyboard-constrained sizes never overwrite a normal
placement. Keyboard dismissal restores it. Header controls do not initiate drags,
and each gesture continues to follow only the input that began it.

Mobile geometry is keyed by orientation, including tablets whose portrait and
landscape modes are both `panel`. A forced mobile `window` layout still uses mobile
geometry. Auto retains its compact placement; explicit Sheet, Panel and Window
use bottom, right and centred placement, respectively. Explicit mode placements
are stored under `ui.mobileSheet.layouts.<mode>` or
`ui.mobilePanel.layouts.<mode>` for the current orientation, keeping Auto and
desktop placements intact. Keyboard positioning uses the reported top edge when available, and
focused mobile fields are revealed through their scrolling ancestors. Desktop
geometry and pointer layouts retain their existing behavior.

When a mobile keyboard leaves too little height for a form, its footer actions
join the body scroll region at their configured control size. Dismissal remains
available; keyboard dismissal restores the pinned footer and preserves the fields. Focus
reveal accounts for clipping ancestors and the keyboard edge without repeating
the displacement of an inner scroller. Shared conversation search includes
folder names; create, move and manage flows remain available from the app menu.

Profile avatars start with a readable initial behind a renderable image. A deferred
worker resolves a ready headshot through `Players:GetUserThumbnailAsync` and calls
`ContentProvider:PreloadAsync`, retrying up to three times. It checks `IsLoaded`
after preloading as well as on property changes. Destroying the avatar invalidates
its results without cancelling a coroutine inside a native thumbnail or preload
request. The request finishes naturally and no longer updates the destroyed view;
failed loads retain the initial without blocking UI construction.

The minimize/restore launcher uses parent-relative offsets and a fixed anchor,
preserving the pointer's grab offset after its 6px drag threshold. Only the
initiating mouse/touch controls a gesture. Dragged, cancelled and ignored inputs
cannot activate the button; focus loss, destruction and rebuild release gesture,
service and layout listeners. Placement is saved on drag release, clamped within
the usable viewport, and restored after temporary keyboard or viewport changes.

The Code workspace is owned by `runtime/code_store` and composed in
`ui/panels/code`. Editor, Files, Explorer, Remotes, Output, History, Library and Game changes
are destinations within Code. Layout follows the available panel rectangle. Native
TextBox editing owns source input, selection and IME; escaped line-state syntax
highlighting, a visible caret, virtual labels and an independent gutter remain
available during editing. Source
remains raw and unwrapped. Enter inserts a newline; Run is explicit.

Documents have stable IDs, monotonic revisions and distinct open-view state. They
are loaded once and shared immediately with tools before delayed disk saves.
Closing a view retains its document. Two verified snapshots in reserved `code/`
store documents, versions, proposals, action snapshots and small preferences.
Legacy files are retained; damaged snapshots are copied to verified recovery files
before replacement. Unreadable or future-format data prevents overwriting. Failed
saves retain live drafts and report status. Build replacement preflight protects
pending Code work. Initial limits are 24 documents, 10 open views, 256,000 UTF-8
bytes per editable source, 12 versions per document within 4 MiB of source history,
24 actions and three proposals per document. The serialized envelope is capped at
12 MiB; an oversized envelope preserves live source and reports a save failure.
Larger inspected source, up to 2 MiB, uses a bounded snapshot reader; opening it
does not create temporary files. Explicit exports retain verified file behavior.

`runtime/script_sources` is the shared source/decompile service. Results carry
instance identity/path, runtime epoch, method/origin, status, byte count, capture
time, content hash, read-only state and diagnostics. Empty source is successful;
unavailable objects, unsupported classes, missing/failed decompilers, expired or
stale requests, invalid text and oversized source have distinct structured errors.
Per-instance capability reads do not decompile. Only explicit requests spawn
decompile workers (maximum four, 15-second waiter deadline), deduplicated by target,
method and generation. Late, cancelled and old-runtime results are discarded.
Completed snapshots retain at most eight items/8 MiB with a five-minute TTL; a
visible source view pins its snapshot and hiding/destroying the view releases it.
Host-readable and decompiled documents remain read-only across persistence and
cannot run, accept proposals or become actions until extracted into a separate
editable document. No inspected source is a live binding or automatic write-back.

Shared UTF-8 utilities use one-based byte offsets, exclusive range ends and code
point status columns, not UTF-16 or grapheme-cluster columns. Search and slicing
preserve code-point boundaries. Case folding is ASCII; whole-word classification
treats letters/digits/underscore and non-ASCII bytes as word constituents, without
Unicode linguistic segmentation. Combining characters are not grapheme-aware. Shifted
unchanged lines reuse syntax spans and measurements; multiline lexical state
invalidates dependent lines. TextBox updates still receive the bounded full string.
Drawing pools at most 160 rows, measures long lines in 2 KiB chunks and clips
horizontal syntax windows. Search offers counts/current match, overlays, case and
whole-word options, with a 10,000-match retention limit. Full-snapshot large-source
search can find matches across 6,000-byte display pages.

Storage exposes Saving, Saved, Retry required, Conflict and expired-source states.
An owned partial write can be retried; external modifications are not overwritten.
Typing publishes revision metadata without copying whole documents into events.

Source history is distinct from native TextBox Undo and Game changes. Restore and
proposal application guard source revisions. Actions retain immutable executable
snapshots; updates guard both action and source revisions. Up to 12 named
string/number/boolean/choice inputs are passed as data in `local inputs = ...`.
`tools/code_runner` calls the existing managed execution engine with one manual
workspace run at a time; agent concurrency is unchanged. Retained output identifies
the run/document/revision. `tools/execution.runOperation` manages native calls
without a compiler and reports still-outstanding dispatched calls after timeout or
Stop, never retrying them or claiming to roll back server effects.

`instance_refs`, `instance_fields`, `instance_schema`, `instance_scan`,
`instance_edits` and `changes` serve Explorer and the instance tools. Epoch-scoped
weak identities survive rename/reparent, with bounded pins and stale detection.
Paths reject duplicate-name ambiguity. Supported properties come from a bundled
curated catalog; actual protected reads/writes remain authoritative. Typed edits
preflight expected values, read back engine values, record observed changes and
conditionally recover partial failures. Undo checks every current recorded value
before writing. Tags and hierarchy operations are outside initial Undo coverage.
Edits report local observations, without a server replication guarantee.

Explorer tracks up to 64 branches, searches cooperatively within 20,000 nodes and
returns bounded snapshot cursors. Child enumeration caps at 20,000 children per
branch; UI pages cap at 4,000 rows, and reveal caps at 64 ancestor levels. Counts
separate returned, omitted, filtered and unreadable results and mark unknown totals.
At most eight search snapshots remain; cancelled queries cannot publish shared
state. Runtime services own page merging and query IDs/generations. UI rows are
pooled. Selection is capped at 20
objects and field batches at 100 operations. Drafts survive live updates and view
rebuilds. Create/duplicate/move/detach/delete use exact targets, expected parents and
normalized selections, with the Inspector's epoch, revision, IDs and primary target.
Clicked, focused, primary and selected identities are distinct; selection also has
an anchor and mode. Stale or ambiguous hierarchy actions fail before writing.
Source is a provenance-labelled snapshot, never a live
write-through editor. Nil roots, bookmarks and world picking are explicit. Metadata
export is verified and bounded; no full-map or unverified saveinstance adapter exists.

`runtime/values` supplies packed graphs with exact nil positions, typed Roblox
values, binary encoding and bounded cycle/alias inspection. Unsupported, incomplete,
opaque or cyclic/sparse graphs remain inspectable but cannot replay. `remote_capture`,
`remote_store` and `remote_hooks` own explicit capture sessions independently of GUI.
Imports/schema/state reads install no hooks and send no traffic. Outgoing hooks use
reusable neutral forwarding cells and owned detached routing probes; intercepted
Invoke outcomes have separate unverified coverage. Incoming capture uses events
only, never replaces function callbacks. `hooked_unknown` is the default outgoing
attribution unless verified. Probes do not invoke the predecessor; host network
behavior is not guaranteed. Stop reports whether an inert forwarding wrapper remains.

Capture holds at most 1,000 records within 4 MiB, 128 pending outcomes, 2,048 incoming
subscriptions, 10 pins within an additional 1 MiB, and 32 KiB per typed graph
(16 KiB per string, 256 slots/table nodes, depth 12, 1,024 values). Summaries report
omissions/eviction gaps; details/bytes paginate. View filters, admission filters and
exact-target blocking rules are separate. Pause stops recording; Stop also disarms
rules. Native and tool Start default to 30 seconds; persistence is explicit. The UI
requires a selected remote by default; all-game and subtree capture are explicit.
One target resolver validates the displayed Explorer selection and its primary.
Permission/group/session revocation removes
agent-owned behavior. Capture survives navigation/minimize with a launcher indicator;
unload/reset disarms it. Visible capture/property refresh is coalesced to 10 Hz.

Replay prepares a five-minute immutable plan with target, packed arguments, source
revision, rule revision and digest, then dispatches at most once. Generated bound
source uses expiring runtime bindings; portable snippets resolve explicit paths and
reject ambiguity. Copy/export of portable scripts requires a current source-review
digest. Incoming records expose diagnostics, caller inspection/source and metadata
export; only outgoing records expose replay and editable replay arguments. Caller
identity is captured in hooks, but resolution and source/decompile happen afterward.
Source provenance and bounded name/path text matches accompany exported captures;
these matches suggest call sites without proving them. Opening/importing source
never runs it. Late Invoke completion recalculates both ring and pin byte budgets.
Export freezes records and the maximum sequence before paging, so concurrent
arrivals and completions cannot change the exported snapshot. Reconfiguration
failure explicitly reports that the prior session stopped. Explicit exports use
unique scoped destinations, verified parts and a completion manifest. Imported
captures remain offline until explicit current-target rebinding. Tool summaries and
structured data share a roughly 6,000-byte budget with retained detail pages for
larger operation results.

The Code workspace was introduced in version 1.7.0; the native reliability, chat
and provider improvements ship in 1.8.0. [NATIVE_CLIENT.md](docs/NATIVE_CLIENT.md) is the current
native feature and limitation reference. Native input, touch/gamepad,
executor forwarding/coexistence and performance need the client scenarios in
`docs/CODE_WORKSPACE_TESTING.md`. Historical files in `archive/` are references only.

## 8. Build and verification

Audit changed source, documentation and tests before running
`node tools/test_native.js --build-only`. Inspect its generated bundles,
manifests and catalog before running `node tools/test_native.js --verify-only`.
Verification runs read-only freshness, native static checks, the main native
suite, every focused native suite, performance contracts and the official Luau
compiler, sequentially and fail-fast. After any fix, review the change, rebuild
and inspect affected outputs, then restart verification. Results and suite summaries are in
`refer/native-verification/results.json`. See the native testing guide for setup
and the final diff/scope/generated-output review. This is behavioral contract
coverage and syntax validation, not strict Roblox type analysis or host validation.

The bridge's protocol, installation, browser workflow and verification are
documented in [bridge/README.md](bridge/README.md). Executor downloads start with
`node UAI/bridge/start.txt`; Git checkouts use `node bridge/server.js`. Bridge test
fixtures and helpers live under `bridge/tests/` and are excluded from downloads.

`dist/uai.lua` is what a user runs:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("<url>/dist/uai.lua"))()
```
