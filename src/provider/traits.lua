-- What a model accepts, and how much it can hold.
--
-- Every gateway claims to be OpenAI-compatible and none of them publishes
-- capabilities: /models returns ids, not limits. So the facts that change how a
-- request must be built live here, in one table, rather than being rediscovered
-- from a 400 at each call site.
--
-- Matched by longest substring, the same way `usage.priceFor` resolves a price,
-- because gateways prefix and suffix ids freely -- "anthropic/claude-opus-5",
-- "claude-opus-5-1m", a dated snapshot -- and an exact-match table would miss
-- every one of them. Only families this client has a documented fact about appear;
-- an unknown id resolves to an empty trait set, which means "behave as before".
