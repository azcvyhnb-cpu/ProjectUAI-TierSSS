# Project UAI UI LIB

An independent, responsive Roblox UI library with a graphite-and-porcelain
workbench, inset fields, strong typography, and Project UAI's coral accent.

```lua
local UI = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Project-Ptolemy/ProjectUAI/main/dist/uai-ui.lua"))()
```

Manually review changes, build with `node tools/build_ui_lib.js`, and inspect the
outputs before checking with `luajit test/ui_library.lua`. Follow the full
verification sequence in the guide after client or documentation changes.
The library owns layout, input, state, cleanup, and the permanent
`Project UAI | UI LIB.` footer. Navigation and action labels use text; the library
draws its own brand mark and window-control glyphs. A pinned sidebar profile shows
the local player and game; Roblox supplies the headshot. Owned transitions support
reduced motion. Scripts own application logic.

The visual refresh preserves the v1 API and saved configuration format. Existing
scripts receive the updated window, navigation, controls, pickers and dialogs
without migration. Tab headings and live counts scroll with the content; the
window keeps its touch targets and keyboard-safe layout.

Use the library independently for a script UI, or pass it into a view factory
alongside a live UAI client. `Parent` chooses the owned ScreenGui's parent; it
does not dock a window into a Frame. Keep model state outside controls, use
silent setters for reflection, and register view resources with `window:Give`.
The guide covers local ModuleScript loading, configuration, asynchronous work,
responsive layouts, and adding reusable capabilities under `src/`.
