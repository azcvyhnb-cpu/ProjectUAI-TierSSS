# Project UAI

A universal AI agent that runs inside a Roblox client. It works in any game,
with Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages endpoints, including compatible
local servers and relays.

**Version 2.5.0 — October 2, 2026.** Mobile shares the desktop interface, with
layout dimensions, spacing and radii reduced to 55% before density settings.
Text has a 10px minimum before text scaling, and standard icons start at 12px.
Auto, Sheet, Panel and Window change placement while keeping live fields and
drafts. Forms and Code panels adapt through reflow and scrolling.
Ten new script project tools add scaffolding, source maps, coordinated file edits,
syntax/dependency diagnostics, managed tests and standalone Lua bundles.
UI LIB remains v1.2.1 and the embedding SDK remains 1.0.0.
See the [release notes](CHANGELOG.md) and [UI library guide](docs/UI_LIBRARY.md).

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azcvyhnb-cpu/ProjectUAI-TierSSS/main/dist/uai.lua"))()
```

Nothing about a specific game, gateway or host script is assumed. Under an
executor it uses the executor's HTTP function; in a plain client it falls back to
`HttpService` and says which capabilities it lost. Embedded in a host script it
takes a context table and adds that script's own instructions and hooks.

Running the same bundle again toggles the existing interface; embedding hosts can
pass `{ reuse = true }` to reuse it without toggling. A changed bundle
reloads an idle client after saving its settings and conversations. If work, an
unsent draft, or an isolated conversation would be lost, the current instance stays
open with a notice; finish that work before running the updated loader again.

In **Settings → Import & export → Full configuration**, use **Copy config · includes
API keys** to transfer all saved configuration, including providers, key pools,
custom headers, permissions, preferences, and saved memory. On the other device,
choose **Paste configuration to import**, paste the JSON, select **Review**, then
**Apply**. This private export contains credentials. Conversations, activity history,
workspace files, and skill files are separate from configuration.

## What it is

**Our own script UI library.** [Project UAI UI LIB](docs/UI_LIBRARY.md) provides
standalone, responsive windows and a complete set of script controls using UAI's
visual language. Agents read its bundled `ui_library_docs` reference and write
declarative controls plus application logic. The library handles layout, input,
configuration, cleanup, and the fixed `Project UAI | UI LIB.` footer.
The existing agent client interface is unchanged.

```lua
local UI = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azcvyhnb-cpu/ProjectUAI-TierSSS/main/dist/uai-ui.lua"))()
```

See the [starter](ui-lib/examples/starter.lua), [component showcase](ui-lib/examples/showcase.lua),
[full API and application guide](docs/UI_LIBRARY.md), and
[complete assistant workbench](examples/embedding/README.md).
The [embedding reference](docs/EMBEDDING.md) covers host scripts, custom UIs,
sessions, tools, hooks, providers, state binding, and cleanup.

**Embedding SDK 1.0.0.** Load the client with `{ ui = false, reuse = true }` to
use sessions and tools without mounting its application. `uai.sdk` provides
owned integration scopes and requests with structured results, cancellation,
completion callbacks, and optional waiting. Open named conversations without
changing the user's selection, and explicitly mount the app when needed with
`uai.show(...)` or `uai.openSession(id)`. Start with the
[UI-free SDK example](examples/embedding/sdk.lua) and
[SDK quickstart](docs/EMBEDDING.md#sdk-quickstart). Providers and permissions remain
shared client settings; runtime capabilities still depend on the host.

**A real agent loop.** Streaming, parallel tool calls, retry with backoff that
honours `Retry-After`, provider fallback, automatic context compaction with a
summary, permission gating, hooks, a task list, persistent memory, subagents that
run several at a time, token and cost accounting, abort, and a request log. Every
stage emits an event, and the interface is a subscriber -- the loop never touches a
GUI.

Context windows are learned automatically from provider context-length errors and
saved per model. A rejected turn compacts older history and retries once before
falling back. Repeated compactions merge the previous summary, and a failed summary
request preserves earlier facts. Open **Message options → Context breakdown** for a
colored usage bar, category totals, model window, and compaction point. Compaction
notices show the estimated token reduction. Individual saved facts can be deleted
in **Settings → Skills → Memory**.

A turn stops after twenty-four tool rounds by default, which is there to catch a
runaway rather than to end the work; **Unlimited tool calls** in Settings removes
that ceiling and the fifteen-minute turn deadline with it, leaving the repeat
breaker, each tool's own timeout and Stop as what bounds a turn. A subagent keeps its
own step and time budget under that switch -- it is the one session nobody is
watching -- and **Unlimited subagents** is the separate switch that lifts a child's
too, so a delegated job runs until it answers instead of coming back with "I reached
this session's step limit before finishing".

**Any provider.** A provider is a base URL, an auth style, a key and a model.
Presets exist for the common hosts -- with HCNSEC, AgentRouter, and OpenCode Zen featured as
starting points in the providers panel -- and "Custom endpoint" takes anything
that speaks `/v1/chat/completions` -- a relay, a self-hosted vLLM, Ollama on
localhost. Model lists are never guessed: they come from `GET /v1/models` or from
you typing one in.

For the shared HCNSEC key, open **Providers → Add → HCNSEC → Use free key**,
fetch the current models or enter a model ID, then save. Your other providers and
personal keys stay as configured. OpenCode and AgentRouter automatically recover
from explicit unauthorized-client errors using the
[Project UAI proxy](docs/PROVIDER_COMPATIBILITY.md#automatic-unauthorized-client-recovery).
The proxy receives the provider key and request and has a shared limit of 90,000
requests per day; the resulting Base URL remains editable.

AgentRouter uses the Anthropic Messages API and always sends its required Claude
Code identity. Registration requires a GitHub account at least one year old; its
recommended model is `deepseek-v4-flash`.

**The Claude Code identity.** Providers that enable this compatibility identity carry
`User-Agent: claude-cli/<version> (external, cli)`, `x-app: cli` and the
`X-Stainless-*` client-metadata set, applied inside the transport so no call site
can omit it accidentally. OpenCode Zen retains its OpenCode compatibility headers. Its free-tier access is
provider-controlled, so compatibility headers do not guarantee availability.
`HttpService:RequestAsync` refuses to send a custom `User-Agent`, so
on a host with no executor HTTP function the client says the identity did not
reach the wire rather than pretending it did.

**Native tools for any game**: the instance tree,
properties with type-aware conversion, bounded Luau execution, files, HTTP, web
search and page reading, players, your character, raycasts and lighting and the
camera, remotes (discover, fire, watch), on-screen interfaces, diagnostics, place
and account metadata, plus the agent's own task list, memory, searching and
reading its earlier conversations, and subagent dispatch.

**Code workspace — v1.7.0, September 24, 2026.** Open **Code** and
choose Editor, Files, Explorer, Remotes, Output, History, Library, or Game changes.
The user and agent share live Luau documents and revisions. Source highlighting,
line numbers, Find, Go to line, indentation, explicit Run/Stop, retained output,
versions, comparison/proposals and typed reusable actions use the same model.
Focused editing uses the native TextBox for input, selection and IME, with visible
syntax colors and a caret while typing. Closing a view preserves its script in the
library. Source documents use two verified snapshots under `UAI/code/`.

Inspected Source and decompiled text are read-only snapshots. **Extract editable
copy** creates a separate document; opening source never runs it or writes back to
the live script. Source requests share bounded workers and a cache, with explicit
provenance, refresh, cancellation and expiry. Search/selection use UTF-8 byte
boundaries; displayed columns count Unicode code points.

Files browses the `UAI` workspace through expandable folders. Open a file in the
editor, then use Save or Save as; disk-conflict checks protect edited drafts.
Run and Save stay adjacent. Buttons and tabs retain padding across narrow layouts,
touch input and larger text, with horizontal scrolling for crowded action strips.

Explorer provides lazy child pages, name/class/tag search, multiple selection,
supported properties, typed attributes/tags, guarded edits, hierarchy operations,
bookmarks, world picking, source opening and selected metadata export. Stable
object references survive renaming and moving. **Game changes → Undo** covers
recorded property and attribute changes with conflict checks. Tags, hierarchy,
remote effects and arbitrary Luau side effects are outside that Undo coverage.
Inspector actions carry the displayed selection's IDs, primary object and revision.
Search and branch pages show partial results and limits: 20,000 runtime children or
scanned nodes, 4,000 displayed rows, and a 64-level reveal path.

Remotes starts only through an explicit scoped **Start**. It supports UAI calls,
incoming events and host-dependent outgoing interception, with bounded capture
lists, typed values, filters, replay drafts, reviewed one-shot replay, generated
source and offline export/import. Excluding logs and blocking traffic are separate
controls. Stop disarms traffic rules; capture stays visible on the minimized
launcher. A timed-out InvokeServer may remain outstanding and must not be retried
automatically. **More → Capture coverage** explains the actual backend and limits;
intercepted Invoke outcomes remain unverified and incoming function callbacks are
unavailable.

The default capture lasts 30 seconds and requires a selected target. Game-wide
capture and continuous capture are explicit choices. Caller actions resolve the
captured script identity after capture and can open read-only source with likely
remote name/path matches. Generated portable scripts require current review before
copy/export. Hooked traffic is labelled `hooked_unknown` unless attribution has
been verified; routing probes do not invoke the predecessor, but network behavior
depends on the host. Stop can retain an inert forwarding wrapper.

See [the native feature contract](docs/NATIVE_CLIENT.md) for current features and
limits and [the native testing guide](docs/CODE_WORKSPACE_TESTING.md) for
desktop/mobile/gamepad scenarios. Native input, hook forwarding and performance
require Roblox client validation.

**Batch inspection and file workflows.** Prefer a combined query or batch when
the work is independent; this reduces model round trips and unnecessary local
scanning without changing the inference provider's speed.
The prompt asks for successive batches of normally 1–4 independent calls, with
results inspected between batches. Tool-call limits and concurrency stay unchanged.

**Script projects.** Stage modular scripts with `project_scaffold`, inspect their
file hashes and dependencies with `project_map`, and apply coordinated edits with
`project_patch`. `script_analyze` reports syntax/dependency diagnostics;
`project_build` exports one runnable Lua file; `script_test` runs declared cases
through the managed client engine. Proposals include temporary, conditional
recovery checkpoints. See [the script project guide](docs/SCRIPT_PROJECTS.md) for
the manifest, test API and limits. These are native tools, without an LSP or an
isolated test process.

**Long inputs are files.** Inputs over 8,000 UTF-8 bytes are saved intact under
`UAI/pastes/`, up to 2 MiB per file. The AI receives a compact path reference and
reads relevant sections with `file_read`, `file_read_many`, or `file_search`.
Saved-paste reads return at most 6,000 source bytes per slice with continuation
offsets. Ordinary messages stay inline. A large paste becomes an attachment while
keeping the text already around it editable, and an attachment can be sent by
itself. The browser transfers large files in separate chunks before sending the
message. Saving must succeed and the Files tools must be available; failures keep
the draft instead of sending the full source. These are files in the executor's
workspace, so the workflow works across inference providers without requiring a
provider-specific file API.

**A folder per game.** Game work is organised under `UAI/files/<place name>
(<PlaceId>)/`: scripts the agent writes or edits sit in that folder's root, and
decompiled or dumped source lands in its `dump/` subfolder, apart from the code
being authored. The name is taken from the live place and stripped of any
path-reserved characters. This is the default home, not a wall -- shared
utilities, another place's folder, cross-game notes, and `pastes/` all stay
reachable, so the agent still reads and writes elsewhere under `files/` when the
task or the user calls for it.

**Project Gravity.** Run the updated [Project Gravity](https://github.com/Project-Ptolemy/Project-Gravity-02)
loader and open its **PROJECT UAI** button. Both desktop and mobile pass their live
context; UAI can also discover Gravity when either application starts first, or run
the loader itself with `gravity_launch` when Gravity is not already present.
`gravity_status` and `gravity_shapes` inspect the real engine and shape controls.
`gravity_control`, `gravity_configure`, `gravity_shape`, and `gravity_target` use
Gravity's native handlers for physics, settings, shape switching, buttons, and
player targets. The Project Gravity tool group uses UAI's normal permissions.

`gravity_parts` pages through held parts with session-scoped IDs and their current
selection, targets, and overrides. Use those IDs with `gravity_part_control` to
select parts, pin them, assign a shape, move a group while preserving its spacing,
set rideability or physics, and release overrides. `clear` deselects;
`release_all` clears overrides even on unselected parts. Selection follows
Gravity's native 512-part ceiling. Read fresh IDs after Gravity reloads.

`gravity_keybind` sets core or shape shortcuts and rejects conflicting keys;
an empty key clears a binding. `gravity_favorite` manages the native favorites
list. `gravity_configure` also exposes interface and visual performance settings,
FPS (when supported), RGB core color, ignore tags, and Part Control panel defaults.
`gravity_control` supports `reset_settings` and manual Slingshot `launch`/`charge`.
The companion Gravity update applies settings to the live world and interface,
restores reset effects and bindings, and supplies the same shape/hotkey handlers
on desktop and mobile. Check `gravity_status.capabilities` after reloading it.

For custom shapes, read the guide with `gravity_plugin_read`, or request
`section="template"`. Pass `plugin="My Shape", path="pastes/..."` to
`gravity_plugin_write` to reuse uploaded source without copying it into tool
arguments. It verifies the file in `GravityShapes/`, validates setup once, and
registers it with the running Gravity session. Select an inactive shape explicitly
with `gravity_shape`; replacing an existing shape requires `overwrite=true`.
`load=false` checks syntax and saves without executing the source. Gravity's live
physics and mobile touch behavior still need in-game testing.

| Tool | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `instance_query` | Filter by name, class, and tag while reading selected properties and attributes. Pages stop early and include a traversal offset. |
| `instance_get_many` | Inspect up to 20 known paths with individual errors and a continuation index. |
| `file_search` | Find literal text across workspace files, with filename globs, case selection, line numbers, byte offsets, and a cursor. |
| `file_read_many` | Read up to 12 files or saved pastes with a shared output budget, individual failures, and per-file continuation offsets. |
| `file_edit_many` | Apply up to 20 ordered exact edits to one file after all edits validate, using one write. |

Instance projections accept up to 12 property names and 12 attribute names.
Copy returned instance paths exactly: `Workspace["Map.v2"]["Door[1]"]` refers to
names that contain punctuation. Query pages inspect at most 20,000 nodes; narrow
the root if a scan is incomplete. Traversal offsets describe the live tree, so
restart after it changes.

File searches default to `UAI/files/`; pass an explicit `pastes/` path to search
saved inputs. Both scopes exclude client configuration and conversations.
Searches skip binary files and files over 2 MB, bound inventories to
128 directories, 1,000 files, and 6,000 entries, and process at most 8 MB and 50,000
new lines per page. The read budget counts skipped data too and is checked between
whole-file reads; the host must read a file before its size is known.
Follow the returned cursor with the same query and restart
after editing sources. Batch reads support files up to 2 MB and reuse repeated
slices within that call. Edits preflight against the original file, refuse stale
contents, avoid no-op writes, and limit the original and resulting file to 2 MB.
The existing Files and Instance tree permissions and capability checks apply.

**An interface built from tokens.** No use site writes a colour or a number. One
warm neutral ramp and one accent, surfaces separated by two steps of lightness and
a hairline rather than by shadows, a cream fill for the single loud action per view,
and the accent kept for meaning -- inline code, a running turn, a risk level. Type
comes from `FontFace` where the client has it, so a family yields a real
regular/medium/semibold axis instead of whichever weights the legacy `Enum.Font`
happened to pair it with; the families on offer are probed against the engine rather
than declared, so the list is shorter on an older client instead of containing dead
entries. A reply is the page rather than a bubble on it: the agent's prose sits flat
on the canvas, tool rows and reasoning are lines of text rather than cards, reasoning
sits behind a rule as an aside, and sent prompts group their speaker and text inside a quiet bordered surface.
The compact composer stays pinned to the bottom edge, with context details behind
its overflow menu. The model stays inline when space permits; model, permission,
and usage controls are always available from the same menu. The contrast
of every pair the interface puts together is computed in the test suite, so a retune
cannot quietly make something unreadable.

**Markdown tables and compact thinking.** Replies support aligned pipe tables with
formatted cells and horizontal scrolling on narrow screens. Long tables and thinking
traces have bounded scroll areas without dropping their content. Thinking starts
collapsed; consecutive trace updates share a disclosure until a tool separates them.
The model picker keeps search and selection stable, and its provider selector and
the composer's model chip size to their actual labels.

**Mobile layout.** The desktop header, sidebar, welcome view, composer, Quick Chat
and Code tabs share one structure at 55% layout dimensions, spacing and radii
before density settings. Controls have a 15px minimum, text starts at 10px before
text scaling, and standard icons at 12px. Enter adds a line; the Send button
submits. Expand the composer for a longer draft, or use Message options for
models, attachments and context. The sidebar and app menu keep conversation
search. Settings categories and providers reflow between columns and scrolling
strips while preserving their mounted forms.

Auto keeps a compact placement; Sheet, Panel and Window select bottom, right
and centred placement, with separate saved positions. Drag the title to move,
use the corner grip to resize, or expand to fill the available screen. Rotation
preserves drafts, selections and open forms; the keyboard temporarily lifts the
window and keeps focused fields in view. The launcher returns when minimized.

**Managed in-game chat loops.** Ask for a quiz, rotating announcements, or keyword
replies. `quiz_bot`, `auto_chat`, and `auto_reply` return a background job immediately;
`chat_loop_status` reports progress and quiz scores, and `chat_loop_stop` stops jobs.
Active jobs also have a Stop all control in chat. Loops have configurable intervals,
counts, and durations, and stop when their conversation is cleared or removed, chat
is disabled, or the client unloads.

**Infinite Yield control and plugin authoring.** `iy_control` inspects and changes
IY's native event bindings, keybinds, aliases, waypoints, command prefix, and supported settings. It
supports `OnExecute`, `OnSpawn`, `OnDied`, `OnDamage`, `OnKilled`, `OnJoin`,
`OnLeave`, and `OnChatted`, including player/message/health filters, delays, and
`$1`/`$2` command arguments. Changes refresh IY's editor and request its normal
save; results say when only live session state is available. Inspect first for
current binding indexes. `stop_loops` sends IY's `breakloops` command, which stops
repeat prefixes; event bindings and individual commands' own loops are managed
separately. The adapter follows the upstream
[event editor and plugin loader](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/blob/master/source),
reviewed September 20, 2026.

`iy_cmds` includes argument signatures and short descriptions when the running IY
exposes them. `iy_players` resolves selectors such as `others`, `rad50`, and
`all-me` to live names before a targeting command. It uses IY's own selector
engine, including comma-separated lists and `@name` username-only prefix matching.
Its text is bounded by `limit`; structured results retain the complete name list.

Use `alias_add`, `alias_remove`, or `alias_clear` to manage aliases. An alias
targets a command name, including an existing command alias; arguments are not
stored in it. `waypoint_add` accepts `{x,y,z}` coordinates or uses your character's
current root position, flooring each coordinate to match IY. `waypoint_remove`
and `waypoint_clear` affect the current place; `waypoint_clear` with
`all_places=true` also clears saved waypoints in other places. Inspect
`section="aliases"` or `section="waypoints"` and follow `nextOffset` for more.
Edits preserve the live table references used by IY's GUI and request its save.

`configure` also supports `gui_scale` (0.4–2) and `logs_webhook` (an HTTP(S) URL,
or an empty string to disable). These dispatch IY's own commands asynchronously;
inspect settings to confirm the resulting values. Those commands save through
IY, so they reject `persist=false`; other native edits support session-only changes.

`iy_plugin_read` without a filename returns a multi-command template. Pass a
filename to read an existing plugin, then use `iy_plugin_write` to create or
update it. Source can declare globals or shared locals above `local Plugin`,
and returns the normal IY table with `PluginName`, `PluginDescription`, and
`Commands`. Every command has `ListName`, `Description`, `Aliases`, and
`Function(args, speaker)`. The writer checks syntax before saving, executes setup
once when loading, validates the returned table before replacing commands, and
reports their actual registered names, including IY's collision suffixes.
`load=false` saves without executing; replacing a file requires `overwrite=true`.
Plugin source and commands appear in the tool transcript. Plugin-owned connections
and loops should have their own cleanup command so reloads do not duplicate them.

For example, `iy_control` can bind `speed 40` to your next spawn:

```json
{"action":"event_add","event":"OnSpawn","command":"speed 40","conditions":{"player":"me"},"delay":0.5}
```

Resolve nearby players with `iy_players`:

```json
{"selector":"rad50-me","limit":20}
```

Create an alias or a waypoint with `iy_control`:

```json
{"action":"alias_add","alias":"quick","command":"speed"}
```

```json
{"action":"waypoint_add","name":"Home","position":{"x":100,"y":20,"z":-50}}
```

**Task and notification layout.** Task markers share their text's line box at each
font scale, long plans scroll within a bounded area, and disclosure choices stay
with their conversation. Skipped steps are reported separately from completion.
Notifications have a clear outcome, conversation title, and an **Open chat**
action. Opening a conversation acknowledges its own notifications; other unread
conversations keep their badge. Long notifications scroll, hover/focus pauses
expiry, and the stack fits the available screen and keyboard space.

**Independent in-game chatbot.** `chat_bot` listens to new player messages and
answers with the selected AI provider/model using its own short conversation memory.
Set `instructions` for its personality, `prefix` (default `[AGENT]`), and optionally
`user_ids` to choose players. It returns immediately and appears in the chat-loop
indicator; `chat_loop_status` reports its progress and `chat_loop_stop` stops it.
By default it runs for 600 seconds, sends at most 100 replies, and waits at least
5 seconds between sends. Rapid messages are batched into one response. Incoming
message IDs and short-window repeats are deduplicated, self/system/tagged-bot
messages are ignored, and repeated reply text is suppressed for the entire run.
Only one managed job owns a channel, and manual `chat_send` calls are blocked there
while the chatbot runs. A failed or ambiguous chat send stops the bot without retrying.

**Every listing the model produced, in the transcript.** A tool call that carries
code -- the Luau it is about to execute, the body it is about to write to a file, the
property map it is about to apply -- draws it under the row as numbered, horizontally
scrolled, copyable monospace, outside the fold and on by default. A call's listing
folds at a dozen lines rather than sixty, because a turn produces several of them and
the answer they were working towards has to stay on screen. Long blocks fold with a
control that opens them rather than a sentence saying how much was hidden. The
remaining arguments and the result sit behind the row's own caret, and a failure opens
its own. Subagents forward their calls whole, so work delegated to a child is as
readable as work done in the main conversation.

**A turn's machinery is one block, not a wall.** The calls, the thinking between them
and any retry notice go into a single activity block with tight lines inside it and a
paragraph of air around it -- so a turn that called eight tools reads as one thing
that happened rather than as eight events with the reply lost at the bottom. The
header counts the run and its duration, and a finished run of more than four folds
itself away behind that line; anything still outstanding keeps it open.

**Conversations run at the same time.** Switching conversation does not stop the one
you left: its loop is on its own thread, the sidebar spins on it while it works, the
header says how many are going, and the launcher's dot pulses with the window closed.
Each conversation keeps its own task list, and a permission prompt raised by one that
is not on screen still appears -- named with the conversation that is asking, rather
than timing out three minutes later and reporting to that model that you refused.

**Subagents are managed, not just watched.** The Subagents panel is the register: every
dispatch this session made, running ones first, with the task, which conversation asked,
what it is allowed to touch, the tools it has called, how long it has been going, and a
stop for each one that does not stop the turn that dispatched it. Finished dispatches
stay with their report. The four ceilings -- budget, how many run at once, steps per
subagent, and how deep delegation may go -- are on the same panel, and the last two had
no control anywhere before it.

**A dispatch is a conversation, not one question.** Every report carries the
subagent's id, and `agent_followup` sends that same child another message with
everything it found still in context: carry on where the step limit stopped you, now
check this too, quote that line exactly. The transcript shows the second turn as a
follow-up on the same subagent rather than as a new dispatch, and the newest few
finished dispatches keep their context so there is something to follow up on.

A sidebar holds the conversations, grouped by the place each happened in, with
search across their transcripts and two arrows that walk where you have been. It
collapses from the header and comes back the same way, and a conversation reopened
after a restart shows what was said in it rather than a greeting -- the transcript is
written to disk alongside the model's own context, which is the half that used to
travel alone. An
empty conversation opens with prompt starters and an expandable activity card: conversations, messages, tokens,
active days, streaks, the busiest hour, the model that did the most work, and six
months of daily activity as a grid. Every figure on it is counted from what this
client observed and kept -- there is no sample data anywhere in the interface, and
a number with nothing behind it is rendered as a zero and says why.

Long conversations keep dialogue separate from tool activity, so a busy group of
workers cannot push out your questions and replies. History limits are shown when
older detail is removed. Resizing and maximizing preserve the live view; layout
rebuilds remember where you were reading. **Message options → Refresh conversation**
redraws messages and current activity without restarting the script or losing the
draft. Older saves recover missing text when it still exists in saved model context.

**Providers are a list and a detail pane**, not a card grid and a modal form. The
detail names the endpoint a request will actually go to, the model-list route, the
wire protocol, whether a socket is configured (and therefore whether a long reply can
arrive at all), the health counters, the last observed latency, how long a benched
provider has left, and the extra headers, body fields and query parameters the record
sends. The API key is never rendered: it is set through a prompt and shown as its last
four characters.

The layout follows the live viewport: compact desktop controls on handhelds,
a floating resizable window on a desktop, and a large centred panel on a console.
It reflows on rotation and resize, lifts above the on-screen keyboard, and
respects `ReducedMotionEnabled`. Handheld placement follows the selected Auto,
Sheet, Panel or Window mode.

## Layout

`SPEC.md` is the contract every module is written against: the loader, the `env`
table, the provider record, the tool handler signature, the event stream, what is
counted and where it is persisted, and the authoring rules.

## Building and testing

Complete all source, test, build-tool and documentation edits before verification.
The native command runs build, freshness, static checks, the main and every focused
native suite, performance contracts and the official Luau compiler, in that order.
It stops at the first failed stage; after any fix, restart the entire command.

```bash
node tools/test_native.js
```

Prerequisites are Node.js, LuaJIT and the official `luau-compile` executable. Set
`LUAJIT` or `LUAU_COMPILE` to override paths. Stage logs and a behavioral coverage
summary are written to ignored `refer/native-verification/`. There is no line
coverage claim. Sources use a LuaJIT-compatible dialect; the native static checker
enforces it, and the official compiler checks actual Luau syntax. See the testing
guide for the exact stages and compiler setup.

Build-only commands, also after implementation is complete:

```bash
luajit tools/bundle.lua --native
node tools/build_site.js --bundle-only --check
```

The bundle includes a deterministic build ID and per-module hashes in
`dist/uai.manifest.json`. Freshness is read-only and also detects stale embedded
icons. These hashes identify content; they are not cryptographic signatures.

`test/run.lua` loads `dist/uai.lua` -- the actual artifact -- into a mocked
client: a virtual clock so nothing sleeps, an in-memory filesystem, a programmable
HTTP layer that records every request, and an instance mock that resolves absolute
geometry, type-checks property assignments and reports any unknown property or
enum. The scenarios cover boot, capability degradation, the identity headers on
the wire, model discovery, the tool loop, parallel calls, SSE assembly, retry,
provider fallover, permissions, the repeat breaker, abort, context trimming,
payload shape, argument repair, path traversal, viewport changes, theme changes,
markdown, subagents and the parallel dispatch of several at once, a subagent
resumed with a follow-up in the context it already had, the unlimited step budget
for a turn and the separate one for a child, persistence, error surfaces, window
drag and resize, overlay interaction, the layout invariants every surface has to
hold, and the contrast of every colour pair the interface puts on screen. They
also cover the two failure
modes that are invisible from inside a single turn: that the sidebar's collapse
control actually collapses it and offers a way back, and that no string leaves this
client without being valid UTF-8 -- a scraped snippet with one Latin-1 byte in it
used to poison the message history and kill every following request with a
positionless "Can't convert to JSON".

They also pin the interface to real state, which is the part that is easy to fake:
that the activity card counts only what was recorded and survives a restart, that a
history from before the counters existed is recovered from the transcripts rather
than invented, that the conversation list is the threads the client has, that the
permission chip reads the mode actually in force, that an attached file travels with
the message, that a tool family switched off leaves the wire, that every settings
pane builds, and that search finds a conversation by something said inside it.

```bash
luajit test/run.lua --native identity # run one native scenario
luajit test/mock/selftest.lua     # check the mocks themselves
```

Lune can also compile all source modules and the shipped bundle with the real
Luau compiler, then run a scenario file through the same offline harness:

```bash
lune run test/lune_runner.luau test/mobile_ui.lua
lune run test/lune_runner.luau test/mobile_workflows.lua
lune run test/lune_runner.luau test/shared_ui_layout.lua
```

These checks use mocked Roblox services. They verify code, geometry and
interactions, but do not render native Roblox text or GUI layouts.

For landscape image review, `test/mobile_snapshots.lua` exports UI trees from the
built bundle under Lune. `node test/render_mobile.js <snapshot directory>` renders
those trees with Playwright/Chromium; set `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` to an external
Playwright installation if needed. These are approximate layout previews. Passing
a second snapshot directory compares desktop UI trees with the previous build.
Native rendering and keyboard behavior should also be checked in the Roblox client.

## Public showcase website

The public site lives in root `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. The
`docs/` copies support GitHub Pages configured to publish from that directory.
Edit the root files, then regenerate the marked catalog and release regions:

```bash
luajit tools/bundle.lua
node tools/build_site.js
node tools/build_site.js --check
node --check script.js
python test/site_static.py
```

The site build uses Node and LuaJIT without npm dependencies. It reads the actual
bundled registry through the offline client harness and refuses stale bundles.
The check mode does not write files. Static checks verify HTML structure, local
links, accessibility references, copy targets, catalog coverage, and publishing
parity without opening a browser or loading media.

For manual browser review, check narrow and wide layouts, 200% zoom, keyboard
navigation and Escape, repeated copying and denied clipboard access, search with
no results, clearing filters, and video playback. The catalog and navigation
remain usable without JavaScript; only search and copy controls need it.

## First run

The interface opens with a floating orb. There is nothing configured, so the
conversation says so and points at the inference configuration. Add an endpoint,
fetch its models or type one, and send a message.

Permissions default to **Ask first**: reads run freely, anything that changes the
game waits for you, and the prompt shows the arguments -- which for `run_luau`
means the code. Read only, Auto and Allow everything are the other three modes, and
the chip under the composer always names the one in force.

Nothing on disk until then, and only three things after: `config.json`,
`sessions/<id>.json` per conversation, and `stats.json` for the activity counters.
A conversation can be marked isolated from the composer, which keeps it out of the
first two entirely.

## Cowork: your browser workspace

Cowork gives your Roblox conversation more room in the browser. Keep Roblox and
its local bridge running on the same computer. **Node.js 18+** is required; there
are no production npm dependencies.

1. In Roblox, open **UAI → Cowork → Download bridge files**. Open a terminal in
   your executor workspace (the folder containing `UAI`) and run:

   ```powershell
   node UAI/bridge/start.txt
   ```

   From a Git checkout, run `node bridge/server.js` from the repository folder.
2. Paste the terminal's **Token** into **UAI → Cowork**, match the printed
   **Port**, and turn **Enabled** on.
3. Open the terminal's browser link, choose a provider and model, and send a
   message. Keep both Roblox and the terminal open.

The installer saves `.txt` files so executors that block executable extensions
can download them. Node verifies the package and restores its real filenames.
No manual renaming is needed. A failed download preserves the previous launcher.
After restarting the bridge, use its new token and browser link.

Choose **Web runtime** in Cowork for live responses when your provider supports
streaming. **Game runtime** uses the provider connection in Roblox. Switch while
work is idle. The provider deadline defaults to 180 seconds and can be changed
in Cowork's advanced settings.

The browser includes conversations, provider/model controls, code attachments,
permissions, tool forms, subagents, chat loops, memory, logs, exports and settings.
Drafts are saved per conversation using asynchronous browser storage. System,
light, dark, and Match Roblox themes work on desktop and small screens.

PNG, JPEG and WebP pictures can be pasted, dropped, or attached for models that
support **image input**. The bridge inserts the actual bytes into Chat Completions
or Anthropic Messages image blocks, including when Game runtime is selected.
Reload the updated client and restart the updated bridge for this capability.
Image bytes remain in bridge memory and expire after 15 idle minutes or restart;
reattach an expired image when needed. Text/code attachments remain readable files.

Roblox remains in control of tools, permissions, memory, accounting, and saved
conversation history. It must stay connected to advance a turn. Refreshing the
browser reconnects to the conversation; use **Stop** to cancel work. Delivery
receipts and streamed replies reconcile without creating duplicate messages.

The bridge binds to loopback, requires a token, checks browser origins, and loads
local UI assets without a CDN. Full configuration exports include API keys;
ordinary browser state does not. See the [bridge guide](bridge/README.md) for
troubleshooting, limits, architecture, and organized Node/Lua/browser tests.

## Embedding

Use UI LIB by itself for a script-owned interface, or load the full client and
connect your controls to its sessions and tools. Read the comprehensive
[embedding guide](docs/EMBEDDING.md) and
[runnable workbench example](examples/embedding/README.md).

```lua
local uai = loadstring(game:HttpGet(
	"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azcvyhnb-cpu/ProjectUAI-TierSSS/main/dist/uai.lua"
))({
	prompt = "This host provides workbench_status and workbench_configure for its local settings.",
})
assert(uai and uai.alive, "UAI did not start; inspect the console error")
uai.show("providers")
```

Register the named host tools through `uai.tools.register` before asking the
agent to use them; prompt text alone does not install capabilities. The returned
handle exposes `env`, `app`, `sessions`, `config`, `providers`, `tools`, `caps`,
`bridge`, and `log`. Runtime methods use dots; UI LIB methods use colons.

The full client always mounts its standard app. UI LIB is independent and mounts
nothing until `CreateWindow`. A same-build client loader rerun toggles the live
instance and ignores new context; reuse a saved handle or `getgenv().UAI` when
attaching another view. Changed builds replace the client only after active and
unsaved work is protected. Pin all bundle/module URLs to one reviewed commit SHA
for reproducible host releases.

## Notes on the constraints

No Roblox HTTP API can read a response body incrementally, so `stream: true` does
not deliver tokens as they arrive -- the whole SSE body lands at once and is
replayed through the parser. It is still requested, because the streamed shape is
where providers put reasoning text and per-request usage. `net/ws.lua` does real
token streaming for a gateway that implements UAI's `{path, headers, body}`
envelope, when the executor exposes `WebSocket.connect`, `websocket.connect` or
`syn.websocket.connect`. It opens one socket per completion. This is a custom
gateway contract, distinct from OpenAI Responses/Realtime and ordinary local
HTTP servers; replacing `http://` with `ws://` does not enable it. Leave the socket
URL empty for normal provider connections. The gateway receives the provider's
authentication headers. Connect/setup failures before sending can fall back to
HTTP; once sending begins, an uncertain outcome cannot trigger a second request.

See [Provider compatibility and WebSockets](docs/PROVIDER_COMPATIBILITY.md) for
the protocol contract, local-server setup, provider matrix and offline coverage.
Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp and SGLang presets use their Chat Completions
APIs. Authentication defaults to none for these local servers; select Bearer when
server authentication is enabled. Tools require a capable model and server
template/parser. Compatibility fixtures require no models, keys or paid inference.

Actual socket frames update the transcript immediately, with coalesced live
previews and one final message. Buffered replies render in full when received;
there is no simulated typing delay. The assistant is instructed to give brief
progress messages between work steps. No prompt can expose tokens still buffered
by the host or force a provider to speak while it is reasoning internally.

Some executors stop HTTP requests after roughly 30–60 seconds even when given a
longer timeout. The old 8,192-token executor ceiling has been removed, including
HTTP fallback. Requests use `agent.maxTokens` (128,000 by default), explicit
overrides, documented model limits and limits learned from provider refusals.
Old saved `agent.executorReplyCeiling` values are ignored.
Native request deadlines remain terminal unless the provider adapter identifies the known empty-response executor wall (20–130 seconds). In that narrow case, it may retry once with reduced reasoning effort and reply ceiling, only when the request can be made smaller. It does not blindly resend an unchanged prompt or fall back to another provider after an unknown outcome. A dispatched socket failure cannot silently send a second HTTP request. Explicit token-limit refusals
can still teach a smaller ceiling. Large prompts can still spend the request
window uploading and prefilling; `agent.contextTokens` remains 1,000,000 by
default and can be lowered when short replies also time out.

Automatic compaction summarises the oldest turns before a request would cross the
budget, and the budget adapts to the model: when its context window is known,
compaction starts at **Compact at** (`agent.contextFraction`, 80% by default) of
that window, with `agent.contextTokens` as the hard ceiling. Pressure includes
estimated messages, the rolling summary, and the system prompt/tool schemas from
the prepared request. Provider usage calibrates that overhead against the history
actually sent; changing providers, endpoints or models does not reuse another
measurement. The context breakdown shares this calculation, labels estimates,
and shows partial totals until the first request is prepared.
**Compact now**, in the composer's message-options menu, folds older turns on
demand; the **Summarise old turns** switch turns the paid summary off while the
conversation is still trimmed to fit. The composer shows a live context-window
counter beside the model -- the share of that budget the next request is expected
to spend -- so the pressure is visible before a compaction happens.

`check_luau` checks syntax without executing code. Both it and `run_luau` accept
either inline `code` or a saved file `path`. Use `check_luau` with
`{"path":"scripts/build.lua"}` to validate a script you edited, then run it by
the same path. Its source stays on the client instead of being generated and sent again. Saved-paste
references resolve the same way as `file_read`.

`run_luau` captures print/warn, tables, and multiple return values, and inserts
cooperative checkpoints in loop
bodies without changing strings or comments. Its `timeout` argument accepts 1–60
seconds and defaults to 10. It waits for functions started through its
`task.spawn`, `task.defer`, and `task.delay` wrappers; errors, Stop, deadlines, and
unload stop those managed tasks cooperatively. An endless spawned task therefore ends at the
deadline rather than continuing silently after the tool returns.

This is not a security sandbox. Dynamically compiled code, blocking engine calls,
and callbacks registered on engine signals can bypass these controls. Later work
in a persistent engine callback is outside a successfully completed call. UAI leaves
native coroutines alive so pending Roblox/executor callbacks cannot resume a thread
it closed. Managed waits and delayed callbacks check cancellation flags, including
after a successful parent returns; `task.cancel` accepts only this script's task
handles. Work suspended outside managed waits can still resume before its next
checkpoint, and the result reports that uncertainty. Changes already made are not
rolled back.

`file_read` and `script_source` return contiguous slices and a continuation
`offset` when more remains. Offsets count bytes and preserve UTF-8 boundaries.
After reading a workspace file, use `file_edit` with exact `old_text` and `new_text`
to change it. The default requires a unique match; `replace_all=true` replaces all
non-overlapping matches. Empty replacement text deletes the match. The tool refuses
a file that changed while the edit was being prepared.
Prefer `file_edit` or `file_edit_many` for targeted changes to large files.
`file_write` is for new files or replacing most of a file; it and `file_append`
reject content over 2 MiB per call before writing.
Build large new scripts in small sections, waiting for each write before the next
append or edit to that file. Each section must be a complete tool call. Interrupted
write arguments are rejected instead of repairing them into a partial edit. If a
provider reports that its tool batch hit the token limit, none of those calls run;
the model receives results asking it to retry with smaller, complete calls.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) or **App menu → What's new** (also under **About**)
for the latest release notes. The in-game notes are bundled with the client;
reload the updated bundle to see them. Updated notes restore the unread marker
even when the client version stays the same.

## Skills

The main and subagent prompts require reading every enabled skill before the first
reply or other work in each new or resumed conversation. Skill bodies are read
through `skills_read`; the inventory alone does not count. Long bodies and
`skills_list` results have byte-offset continuations that fit the tool result
budget. Restricted subagents can read skills without gaining skill-writing tools.
Disabled skills are skipped, and unavailable or denied reads are reported once.

## Unloading

The interface can be removed and everything it started stopped:

```lua
getgenv().UAI.destroy()
```

or from Settings, at the bottom: **Unload UAI**. Destroying the ScreenGui on its
own is not enough -- timers keep ticking, input handlers stay bound to
`UserInputService`, and a later config write would rebuild a window that is no
longer on screen -- so anything outliving the instance tree registers a cleanup in
`runtime/dispose` and the unload drains it. A turn in flight is aborted first and
settings are flushed before the tree goes.
