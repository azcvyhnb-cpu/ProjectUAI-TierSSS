-- Release notes, as data.
--
-- Every release this client has shipped, from the initial commit forward, in
-- the shape the changelog modal renders: one entry per version, one section
-- per category, one line per change. The list is chronological with the
-- newest first because that is how a "what's new" is read -- the top entry
-- is the one a returning user has not seen.
--
-- Version and note revision track what the user opened, so updates within a
-- version restore the menu's "new" marker. Nothing is fetched remotely --
-- the notes a client can show offline are the notes it shipped with, and a
-- version that has to be downloaded to learn what it contains is a version
-- that cannot say anything on a bad network day.
